# 8 Keys to Self Leadership Quiz

Based on Dario Nardi's book, *8 Keys of Self Leadership*, this quiz will allow you to quickly assess your cognitive preferences and levels of development against the standard he sets forward.

The definitions and questions used are not original and are taken directly from the book. Any further questions on cognitive functions should be answered by either reading the book yourself, or doing general study on the internet.

Definitions of the Jungian cognitive functions vary between sources. My inclusion of Nardi's specifically is not an indication that I have any more faith in his definitions than in other sources; largely, this is an exercise to make it easier to use the assessments provided in the book without having to mark up the book or use scratch paper, and intended to be used as a supplement only, not a full evaluation.

Initially, this is designed to be run as a command line interface, but I intend to also publish it to my website when the code is in good enough shape.
