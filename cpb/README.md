#Complete Python Bootcamp

This folder contains various projects and scripts completed for the Complete Python Bootcamp course found on Udemy at: https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/

This does not include all files I worked on for the course, only the actual projects (two milestone projects and a final project which is actually two projects) and related files. The majority of the coursework, including my first project, was done in Jupyter, but I felt more comfortable working in Spyder for the more extensive projects later in the course.
