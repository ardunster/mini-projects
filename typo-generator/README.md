# Typo Generator
This is no more or less than a fun little command line script to introduce (hopefully) believable typographical errors into an input piece of text. 

Script randomly selects one or more errors to introduce and prints the result. 

Uses `re` and `random` modules.


It could use some more work to randomly distribute errors in longer texts, and there is a slight possibility of running out of usable errors before iterating all the requested errors, also in longer texts. Otherwise it seems to be working well, and is loads of fun to play with :D  

Enjoy!
