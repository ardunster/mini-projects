# Typo Generator
This is no more or less than a fun little command line script to introduce (hopefully) believable typographical errors into an input piece of text. 

Script randomly selects one or more errors to introduce and prints the result. 

Uses re and random modules.

It currently basically works as intended, but is not complete.

To do:

- enter more typo options
- fine tune typo frequency in longer texts
- test for bugs (already found one)
