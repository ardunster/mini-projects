 Py Mini Projects

Assorted mini projects that I am making to practice Python code.

Any helpful feedback is welcome! Some of my uploads will be in response 
to course assignments, others may be things I put together myself as a 
test or exploration of concepts. I am currently a student and would be
more than happy to receive constructive advice. Thanks for looking!

Mean and Median:
 
Take numerical input and return a list of inputs, the arithmetic mean, 
and the median.

Planned updates include: 

Graph results including markers for mean and median in graph

UI?


Dice Roller:

Take input for a dice roll and returns results. Any size or quantity 
of die can be used. Displays results and sum, and saves results
and sum to a log file.

Planned updates:

Implement classes?

Dice roll visualization. 3d dice!
