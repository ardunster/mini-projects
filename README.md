## Python Mini Projects

Assorted mini projects that I am making to practice Python code.

Any helpful feedback is welcome! Some of my uploads will be in response 
to course assignments, others may be things I put together myself as a 
test or exploration of concepts. I am currently a student and would be
more than happy to receive constructive advice. Thanks for looking!

My main work has moved on to a larger scale project, currently titled [World Builder Alpha](https://github.com/ardunster/WBA), but I may continue to update smaller scripts and experiments to this repo. 

## In Subfolders:

### CPB:

An assortment of projects for the Complete Python Bootcamp course, including a text based, command line BlackJack game (with persistent player data and card art!) and a small program to fetch latitude and longitude of two entered locations, and calculate the distance between them in one of six possible units of measure as selected by the user. (Operates either on command line or in GUI.)

### Goldsilver:

A script designed to run daily to scrape gold and silver prices from the web, and email price alerts when it does. Also includes supportive scripts that I used to generate the original body of data for calculating 200 day moving averages.

### RDP:

Was going to be for challenges from the reddit daily programmer sub, but at the moment, the sub seems to be inactive, so I only ended up with one script in this folder.

### Typo-generator:

A fun command line script to gather input from the user, then generate random typographical errors in it from an assorted list of possibilities.

## Other files: 

### Mean and Median:
 
Command line script to take numerical input and return a list of inputs, the arithmetic mean, and the median.

### Dice Roller:

Take input for a dice roll and returns results. Any size or quantity of die can be used. Displays results and sum, and saves results and sum to a log file.

I had a couple ideas to expand the functionality of this script which I may some day try, such as programming it to understand modifier syntax (the +4 part of 1d6+4), or if I get ambitious, designing a user interface, or even going so far as to produce visualizations of rolling dice, for fun. Alternatively, I may move this functionality into WBA once I get the core features of that working; sometimes it would be useful to make random rolls in doing world building and story design.
